## Executive Summary: Olist E-commerce Performance Analysis (2016–2018)

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of Olist's ecosystem, evaluating the performance of customers, sellers, and logistics across Brazil.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* **Order Volume & Reach:** Processed **99.45K orders** from **96.10K unique customers**, indicating a vast but largely single-purchase user base.
* **Total Revenue:** Generated **R$ 15.42M** in gross revenue over a 24-month period.
* **Service Quality:** Maintained a strong **97.02% delivery success rate** with an average platform **rating of 4.09/5 stars**.
* **Logistics:** The average fulfillment cycle (order to delivery) stands at **12.5 days.**

### ➤ Sales & Payment Trends

* **Payment Preferences:** **Credit cards** are the dominant payment method. Interestingly, **installment-based payments** drive the bulk of the value, generating **R$ 10.02M**—significantly higher than one-time transactions.
* **Growth Trajectory:** Monthly orders scaled from **zero** in late **2016** to a peak of **6,512** in **August 2018**. However, a sharp contraction occurred in **late 2018** (dropping to **16** orders in September and **4** in October), suggesting a potential data cutoff or operational shift.

### ➤ Market & Seller Dynamics

* **Top Categories:** The most resilient segments are **Household Goods** and **Teen-focused products**, with the top **seven categories** each exceeding **5,000** orders.
* **Geographic Hub:** **São Paulo** is the primary engine of the platform, leading in both volume **(47.30K orders)** and revenue **(R$ 5.77M)**.
* **Seller Landscape:** The platform hosts over **3,000 sellers**. The market is highly fragmented, with no single seller exceeding **2,000 orders**, ensuring a diverse but **competitive merchant base**.

### ➤ Strategic Recommendations

* **Maximize Installment Potential**: With installments driving **64.85%** of revenue, Olist should prioritize marketing high-ticket items with flexible credit options to leverage Brazil’s high-interest consumer behavior.
* **Target High-Growth Segments**: Align "Easy-to-Pay" financing with the most popular categories, specifically focusing on **Household** and **Teenager-oriented** products to capture the core demographic.
* **Improve Customer Retention**: Transition from a single-transaction model to a loyalty-based ecosystem by offering returning customers exclusive discounts or preferential payment terms.

While the platform showed consistent growth through mid-2018, the heavy reliance on installment payments suggests that Olist's revenue is closely tied to consumer credit availability. Additionally, the dominant performance of São Paulo indicates a high geographic concentration that offers both a stable core and an opportunity for regional expansion.

            margin: 10px auto; 
            box-sizing: border-box;"
     align="right">

I developed **14** targeted queries to evaluate Olist’s operational and commercial performance:

* **Geographic Analysis**: Identified the **Top 10 cities** and **states** by order volume and total revenue (Q1–Q4).
* **Product Performance**: Analyzed the **Top 10 categories** by orders, sales, and review scores (Q5.a–Q5.c).
* **Seller Benchmarking**: Ranked the **Top 10 sellers** using `DENSE_RANK()` based on order volume, city, state, revenue, and average rating (Q6).
* **Financial Insights**: Evaluated the most utilized **payment methods** and compared revenue from installment-based versus one-time payments (Q7–Q8).
* **Logistics & Delivery**: Measured **delivery** efficiency by comparing estimated vs. actual dates and calculating average lead times by city (Q9–Q10).
* **Temporal Trends**: Tracked order **volume growth** by year and month (Q11).
* **Customer Loyalty**: Segmented the **user** base into repeat versus one-time customers (Q13).
* **Customer Satisfaction**: Analyzed the **correlation** between delivery speed and review ratings (Q14).

### ➤  Advanced SQL Techniques Applied

To extract these insights, I utilized a comprehensive suite of SQL functions and logic:

* **Complex Joins**: Implemented multi-table `JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN` operations to unify disparate datasets (e.g., linking products to English translations).
* **Window Functions**: Used `DENSE_RANK()` for competitive ranking of sellers.
* **Conditional Logic**: Employed `CASE` statements to categorize delivery statuses and segment payment types.
* **Date Manipulation**: Used `DATEDIFF` to calculate shipping speeds and `DATE_FORMAT` for time-series trend analysis.
* **Aggregation**: Leveraged `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `ROUND`, and `DISTINCT` within `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses to synthesize raw data.
* **Subqueries**: Utilized nested queries to perform multi-level data aggregations.

## Data viz and Data Modeling

To transition to visual insights, I prepared the data using **SQL Views** for each dataset within the **RDBMS** to ensure a clean import process.

### ➤ Data Modeling

Once loaded into **Power BI**, a robust data model was established:

* **Core Tables**: Centered on `Orders` and `Order_Items` as the primary fact tables.
* **Relationships**: Power BI automatically mapped connections between datasets, which I refined into a functional Star Schema.
* **Dynamic Filtering**: I enabled **cross-filtering (both directions)**, ensuring the dashboard responds dynamically to any selected field or category.

* **Top Product Segments**: Five categories drove the most significant volume (each exceeding 5,000 orders): Bed Bath Table, Health & Beauty, Sports & Leisure, Computer Accessories, and Furniture Decor.


### ➤ Payment Dynamics & Consumer Behavior

The analysis reveals a sharp divide in purchasing behavior based on payment structure:

| Feature         | One-Time Payments                          | Installment Payments           |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Revenue         | R$ 5.41M                                   | R$ 10.02M                      |
| Order Volume    | 47.58K Orders                              | 49.66K Orders                  |
| Avg. Rating     | 4.19 / 5                                   | 4.12 / 5                       |
| Top Categories  | Sports, Computers, Health                  | Bed/Bath, Health, Watches      |
| Payment Method  | Diverse (Credit, Boleto, Debit, Voucher)   | Credit Card, Voucher           |

* **Purchasing Power**: Installment payments are a critical revenue driver, accounting for approximately **64.85% of total revenue** (R$ 10.02M), as they allow customers to finance higher-ticket items like watches and furniture.
* **Credit Reliance**: While one-time payments utilize a mix of methods (Boleto, Debit), installment purchases are exclusively powered by credit cards.

### ➤ Seller Ecosystem

* **High Fragmentation**: The platform supports over **3,000 active sellers**.
* **Balanced Distribution**: No single seller dominates the market, with all individual sellers processing fewer than 2,000 orders, ensuring a competitive and diverse marketplace.

<div style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## Strategic Business Recommendations

Based on the data insights from the Olist e-commerce analysis, the following strategic actions are recommended to optimize revenue and customer retention:

### ➤ Capitalize on Installment-Driven Revenue

The analysis reveals that **installment payments generate 64.85% of total revenue**, despite having a similar order volume to one-time payments (49.66K vs. 47.58K).

* **Strategic Promotion**: Olist should actively promote installment plans, particularly for high-ticket items.
* **Revenue Optimization**: Given the high-interest environment in Brazil, expanding installment options allows the business to capture more value while making expensive products more accessible.
* **Category Alignment**: Since the top categories (Bed & Bath, Health & Beauty) already dominate installment sales, targeted marketing in these segments will directly boost the bottom line.

### ➤ Targeted Demographic Focus

The top seven product categories (each exceeding 5,000 orders) are primarily related to **Household Goods** and **Teenager/Lifestyle products**.

* **Segment Targeting**: Marketing efforts should be specifically tailored toward teenagers and women, who drive the volume in these high-performing categories.
* **Integrated Financing**: Combining these popular categories with "Easy-to-Pay" installment options will lower the barrier to entry for younger consumers and head-of-household buyers.

### ➤ Customer Retention & Loyalty Programs

Data shows that the vast majority of Olist’s **96.10K customers** are unique, one-time shoppers.

* **Incentivized Re-purchasing**: To improve the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), the business should implement loyalty rewards or "old customer" discounts.
* **Frictionless Returns**: Offering exclusive installment terms or early-access deals to returning customers will encourage loyalty and transition the platform from a single-transaction marketplace to a recurring shopping destination.

<div style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## Project Limitations

To ensure a transparent and objective analysis, it is important to acknowledge the specific constraints of the Olist dataset:

* **Financial Scope**: The dataset lacks cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) and operational expense data, meaning the analysis is restricted to **Gross Revenue** rather than net profit.
* **Geographic Focus**: The findings are exclusively based on transactions within **Brazil**, and may not be applicable to other international e-commerce markets.
* **Product Granularity**: Data is categorized by **product segment** (e.g., "Health & Beauty") rather than specific product names or SKUs, which limits the ability to perform a deep-dive inventory or brand-level analysis.
* **Economic Variables**: While installment payments are a major factor, the dataset does not include **specific interest rates** or financing fees, preventing a more granular financial impact study.

<div style="border-top: 1px solid black; margin: 10px 0;"></div>

## Future Enhancements
To further evolve this project, the following analyses could be conducted as more granular data becomes available:

* **Financial & Profitability Modeling**: By integrating Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and operational expenses, the analysis could shift from gross revenue to net profit margins and ROI.
